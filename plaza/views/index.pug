                .news-intro2.
                    Agility Plaza has been designed as a 'Web App'. This means that you can install it on your
                    iPhone/iPad or Android device and it behaves much like a conventional app.
                .news.
                    Unlike regular apps, you can't (currently) install web apps directly from an app store. Instead
                    just follow the instructions below:

                        td 1.
                        td.
                            Open www.agilityplaza.com in you Safari web browser. Even if you use another browser, only
                            Apple's own browser has the capability to install a web app.
                    tr

                        td
                            span.
                                Press the menu button:

                            On the 'Add to Home' popup window press the 'Add' button and an Agility Plaza icon will be
                            added to your device. Just press this whenever you want to open the app.
